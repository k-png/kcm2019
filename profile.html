<h2>Hello my name is Keenan Marco I'm 16 and I am a junior this year. I live in Oshkosh Wisconsin. I have five sisters, 4 nephews and a niece. My interests are playing the guitar, videogames, and hangout with friends. My goal for the school year is just to pass and to learn. I really don't know yet what I want do with the rest of my life. I love music I think itâ€™s probably the greatest thing created. I listen to a lot of CCM music and Broadway.</h2>
